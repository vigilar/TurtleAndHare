There was a turtle and a hare. They had a race one day. The hare was 
really fast in the beginning. The turtle was really slow in the
beginning. But then the hare got distracted. The turtle kept on going.
Then the turtle passed the finish line and the hare doesn't.
So the turtle won because the hare got distracted.
