There was a turtle and a hare. They had a race one day. The hare was
injured at the start of the race. So the turtle had more time.
The turtle got distracted and went to play with kids near the track.
The hare kept on crawling towards the finish line because it was
injured. The turtle realized that and started running towards the
finish line. But right before the turtle reached the finish line, the
hare crossed it.
