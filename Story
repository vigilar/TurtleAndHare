There was a turtle and a hare. They had a race one day. It was a hot 
day. The hare was really fast in the beginning and the turtle was slow 
in the beginning. But then the hare got distracted. 
The turtle kept on going. Then the turtle passed the finish line and the 
hare doesn't.
So the turtle won because the hare got distracted.
